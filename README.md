## Project Overview

The **Eye State Detector** is a web-based application designed to analyze whether a person's eyes are open or closed in a given image. The application leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques, specifically using Python libraries such as OpenCV and dlib, to provide accurate and reliable results. This tool can be applied in various fields such as driver drowsiness detection, human-computer interaction, and biometric authentication.
